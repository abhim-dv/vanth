"""Client-side outbound relay for Desktop wake (review rc36 P0).

The persistent daemon never discovers client processes or stores rotating Codex
pipe names. Instead, the Vanth MCP/client integration owns an outbound relay:

1. The relay opens a durable local subscription to the daemon (registering the
   client/session/task identities it can wake) and long-polls for due
   ``codex_desktop`` deliveries.
2. The daemon publishes a generic delivery envelope (delivery_id, destination
   identity, prompt/event payload) plus an opaque lease token.
3. The relay acknowledges ONLY after the client-native prompt admission
   succeeds, presenting BOTH its client identity AND the opaque lease token, so
   only the claiming client can ack (review rc37 P1).
4. A disconnect leaves the delivery pending; a reconnect re-registers and
   resumes from the last acknowledged delivery id.

Only the final adapter differs between clients: OpenCode uses its documented
attached-server/session prompt API; Codex Desktop uses the host-provided
``codex_app/send_message_to_thread`` capability through the inherited
``CODEX_APP_TOOLS_PIPE_PATH``. That private pipe stays inside the Codex MCP
process — it is never sent to the daemon or written to the job database.

Provisioning (review rc37 P0): the real Codex Desktop MCP children do NOT
inherit ``CODEX_APP_TOOLS_PIPE_PATH`` or ``CODEX_THREAD_ID`` ambiently — the
pipe is granted only to the bundled ``codex_app`` MCP integration. The relay
therefore accepts the capability through an explicit, supported handoff:

- ``VANTH_CODEX_DESKTOP_PIPE``: the named-pipe path (set by ``vanth setup``
  when it provisions a Desktop wake integration, or by a host wrapper that
  launches Vanth with the granted capability).
- ``VANTH_CODEX_DESKTOP_THREAD``: the caller/executor thread identity (the
  outer ``params.threadId`` the host requires). If unset, ``CODEX_THREAD_ID``
  is used (CLI MCP processes).
- The pipe path is ALSO read from a per-home ``codex_desktop.json`` capability
  file written by ``vanth setup desktop``.

The relay NEVER silently no-ops: if the capability is absent it records an
explicit diagnostic (returned by ``start_desktop_relay``) so Desktop wake is
known to be unavailable rather than silently pending.

EXPERIMENTAL (review rc38 P2): the private host-pipe contract is not documented
by official Codex material. This integration is explicitly experimental and
scoped to ONE provisioned task per Desktop lifetime: one per-home capability
file stores one pipe/thread tuple, provisioning a second Desktop task overwrites
the first, and a Desktop restart invalidates the private pipe (stale capability
is detected and surfaced, not silently used). Automatic or durable multi-task
Desktop wake is NOT supported yet.
