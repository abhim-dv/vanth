# Changelog

All notable changes to Vanth are documented here.

## Unreleased

## 1.1.1 - 2026-08-18

- `vanth status` and `vanth doctor` now show MCP client registration state
  (`opencode=configured, codex=not configured, ...`) and point at `vanth setup`
  when something is missing.
- The MCP server prints a one-line stderr hint on startup when a known client
  isn't configured yet (suppress with `VANTH_NO_SETUP_HINT=1`).

## 1.1.0 - 2026-08-18

### MCP client setup

- New `vanth setup` command that connects the MCP server to the clients
  installed on the machine in one step. It detects opencode, Codex, and
  generic `mcpServers`-style clients (Claude Code / Cursor), backs up each
  config it touches (`*.vanth-setup-<ts>.bak`), and upserts the Vanth MCP
  entry without disturbing anything else in the file.
  - `vanth setup` — detect and configure everything found (prompts before
    changing).
  - `vanth setup --yes` — apply without prompting (scripts/CI).
  - `vanth setup opencode codex` — only specific clients.
  - `vanth setup --json` — machine-readable result.
  - `vanth setup --remove` — remove the Vanth MCP entries instead.
  - `vanth setup --help` — usage.
- MCP stdio tests now spawn `python -m vanth` instead of `uv run vanth`,
  so they don't trip over a running daemon locking the venv's entry-point
  scripts on Windows.

## 1.0.1 - 2026-08-18

- Packaging: add Apache-2.0 `LICENSE`, production PyPI metadata (classifiers,
  URLs, keywords), and point the quick-start install back at `uv tool install
  vanth` now that the package is published. No runtime changes.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-08-18

First supported v1 release. Vanth is a localhost background-job daemon and MCP
interface for agents: start detached jobs, receive `AGENT_EVENT` structured
events, wait on durable SQLite state, and wake Codex or OpenCode sessions when
a job needs attention.

### Operations CLI and daemon lifecycle

- New `vanth` subcommands for humans (not MCP): `vanth status`, `vanth doctor`,
  `vanth restart`. `status` reports daemon up/down, pid, schema, running jobs,
  delivery counts (supports `--json`); `doctor` prints a human-readable health
  report; `restart` gracefully stops the daemon and starts a fresh one (jobs
  survive — runners are detached).
- The daemon gains an authenticated `POST /shutdown` route so a client can
  request graceful shutdown over loopback HTTP (used by `vanth restart`).
- `VanthClient` now honors `VANTH_DAEMON_HOST`/`VANTH_DAEMON_PORT` when no URL
  or discovery metadata is present, so clients and `vanth restart` work on
  non-default ports.
- The terminal monitor ships as a bundled native Go binary via the
  `vanth-monitor` console script (platform-tagged wheels, no Go toolchain
  needed at runtime).

### Telemetry (schema v8)

- `metric_series` table: scalar fields of `metric`/`progress` AGENT_EVENTs are
  mirrored into queryable series (job, metric, x/y, stage, event id, seq,
  timestamp), matching the Go monitor's transform semantics (`_step` as x,
  `progress.current`/`total`/`percent` derived).
- `artifacts` table: jobs can carry named artifacts (checkpoints, CSVs,
  rendered outputs) with uri, kind, size, sha256, and meta.
- New MCP tools + HTTP routes:
  - `job_metrics_query(job_id, metric?, from_ms?, to_ms?, limit?)` — read scalar series.
  - `job_metric_compare(job_ids, metric, aggregation)` — compare a metric across runs
    (latest/mean/min/max/sum/count).
  - `job_run_summary(job_id)` — one-call "did it work?" (status, runtime, progress,
    latest metrics, artifacts).
  - `job_artifact_add(job_id, name, uri, ...)` and `job_artifacts(job_id)`.
  - `job_dashboard(job_ids?, limit?)` — downsampled chart-data view for any renderer.
- SQLite schema bumped to v8 (adds `metric_series`, `artifacts` tables);
  existing homes migrate with a backup. Go fixture/conformance updated to v8.

### Agent-facing features (schema v7)

- `job_status` / `job_view` now return the job's `command`, `cwd`, `env`,
  `timeout_seconds`, `notes`, a `run` overview (author, hostname, OS, Python
  version, CPU/GPU, git repo/branch/commit), and `runtime_seconds` — so an
  agent can answer "what is this job?" without reading logs.
- `job_list` accepts `name` (substring) and `tags` filters.
- `job_events` accepts `reverse=true` to return the newest events first, with
  backward paging via `since_event_id`.
- `job_rerun(job_id)` relaunches a job with its original command, cwd, env,
  timeout, name, tags, notes, origin thread, and wake targets.
- The daemon writes `daemon.json` discovery metadata atomically on start
  (url, pid, started_at, schema) and removes it on graceful shutdown; the MCP
  client discovers the daemon URL from it.
- `vanth.agent_logger` routes loguru records into structured `AGENT_EVENT`
  log events (timestamped, level-aware, with context) persisted in the event
  table.

### Migration and state

- Ordered SQLite migrations driven by `PRAGMA user_version`.
- A timestamped backup of an existing database is created under
  `VANTH_HOME/backups/` before any migration runs.
- SQLite uses WAL mode with a configurable `busy_timeout`
  (`VANTH_BUSY_TIMEOUT_MS`, default 30000) and foreign keys enabled.
- Event sequence numbers are allocated inside a `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction,
  so concurrent runner/daemon processes can never allocate the same per-job
  `seq`.
- The per-event SQLite write lock is no longer held during the JSONL mirror
  append; transient `database is locked` is retried for events, workload PID
  publication, heartbeats, and terminal transitions; a reader thread survives a
  single failed persist instead of dying and losing the stream.

### Security

- The daemon requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every data route.
  The token is generated per home, stored owner-only, and never logged.
- On daemon start the state directory's permissions are re-tightened to the
  owner only (Unix `0700`/`0600`; Windows `icacls` disables ACL inheritance and
  grants only owner, SYSTEM, and Administrators). This prevents a broad
  profile-level grant (e.g. a sandbox group with read access to the user
  profile) from exposing the bearer token or per-job env/spec data.
- The daemon binds only to loopback addresses; a non-loopback
  `VANTH_DAEMON_HOST` is rejected. On Windows, socket `SO_REUSEADDR` is
  disabled so a second daemon cannot silently become a phantom listener on the
  same port; a failed bind releases the home lock and exits cleanly.
- An upstream `pydantic-settings` warning (an unresolved `lifespan` forward
  reference in mcp's FastMCP) that printed on every console-script invocation
  of a fresh install is suppressed.
- One OS-backed daemon lock per `VANTH_HOME`; a second daemon exits quickly.

### Delivery

- Durable at-least-once wake delivery with leases, claim tokens, and attempt
  history (`job_delivery_attempts`), automatic due retries, and crash ambiguity
  surfaced as reclaimed attempts.
- `delivery_id` is the idempotency key in every adapter payload.
- Codex app-server (`initialize -> thread/resume -> turn/start`) and OpenCode
  CLI (`opencode run --session <id> --format json`) adapters. The OpenCode
  default command is resolved through `shutil.which()` so npm `.CMD` shims work
  on Windows.

### Operations

- Graceful signal shutdown that drains in-flight work and leaves detached jobs
  recoverable.
- Bounded rotating daemon and per-job runner diagnostic logs; bounded per-stream
  log caps with `log_truncated` events; structured event cap per job.
- `job_doctor` readiness and `job_cleanup` with dry-run and tombstones.
- Windows Startup/Task Scheduler action (`deploy/vanthd.cmd`) and Unix systemd
  user service (`deploy/vanthd.service`) templates.

### Compatibility and packaging

- `mcp` is pinned to `>=1.0,<2.0` because mcp 2.0 removed
  `mcp.server.fastmcp`.
- The wheel bundles a native Go monitor binary (platform-tagged,
  `py3-none-<platform>`), built by a hatchling build hook; no Go toolchain is
  needed to install or run it.
- CI workflow (`github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the suite, compile check, wheel
  build, and an isolated wheel import smoke on Windows and Linux for Python
  3.11 and 3.12.
- Release-gate matrix: `scripts/chaos_matrix.py` (50-job x 500-event burst with
  exact counts, slow-adapter non-blocking, daemon kill/restart recovery, runner
  kills, malformed-input battery, log caps and cleanup idempotence) and
  `scripts/real_adapter_smoke.py` (opt-in real Codex/OpenCode wakes; records
  installed versions).

### Limitations

- `job_send` and interactive stdin are not implemented; jobs run with stdin
  closed.
- A daemon crash after an external wake adapter accepts the side effect but
  before Vanth records success remains inherently at-least-once ambiguity.
- Live Codex/OpenCode wake smokes are opt-in and were not run during release
  validation; fake-adapter contract tests cover the protocol.
